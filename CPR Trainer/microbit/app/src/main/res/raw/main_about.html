	<h2>About This Application</h2>
	<p>
		The purpose of this application is to serve as an academic training tool for teaching the general public about CPR. In Australia, around 30,000 people may suffer a sudden cardiac arrest each year. Out of these 30,000 people, only around 9-10% survive.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal of this application is to teach those uninformed about cardiac arrest, and to ensure that signs of a cardiac arrest are prevented in the first place by recognising the symptoms.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Symptoms of Cardiac arrest include:
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Chest pain or discomfort
		</li>
		<li>
			Rapid or irregular heartbeats
		</li>
		<li>
			Shortness of breath
		</li>
		<li>
			Lightheadedness/dizziness where the affected person may feel like fainting
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		By teaching signs of recognition and immediate CPR training, we can increase the survival rate of those who suffer cardiac arrest.
