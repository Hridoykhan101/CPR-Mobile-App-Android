        <h1>CPR TEST</h1>
        <h2>Ideal Results</h2>
        <p>
            Users should aim to achieve the following stats to perform adequate compression training:<br>
            - 100 to 120 CPM (Compression per Minute).<br>
            - 80% or higher compression fraction.<br>
            - 1/3 of the chest depth (5cm in Average).<br>
        </p>
        <h2>How to use:</h2>
        <p>
            - CPR TEST is where you are able to conduct CPR training to mimic a real life scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The Gauge will indicate how deep you compress alongside a depth measurement.
        </p>
        <p>
            - An indicator measuring "SPEED UP, GOOD, or SLOW DOWN" will relate to your compression rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The Rate will indicate the speed as to which you are performing compressions.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The Depth will indicate how deep you are currently performing compressions.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The Compressions will indicate how many compressions you have completed, whether they be complete or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The Complete Compressions will indicate how many full compressions you have completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Select the "Restart Test" option to restart the timer alongside the visible measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The set time is directly underneath the gauge. This can be changed in the 'settings' tab.
        </p>
