    <h1>Device List</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To use this application with your mannequin you must ensure it is connected to Bluetooth.</p>
    <h3>1. Pair your mannequin with your phone or tablet</h3>
    <p>You can pair your mannequin with your phone quite easily using the Bluetooth screen within Android's Settings screen. The best way to learn how to pair with your mannequin is to watch it being done by someone else.</p>
    <p>The pairing procedure is described below as well if you prefer to read rather than watch.</p>
    <p>Pairing makes your phone and mannequin know and trust each other. Behind the scenes it equips them each with various encryption keys which they can use for security purposes.</p>
    <p>You do not need to pair your mannequin and phone every time your use them together. They will stay paired until either one of the two devices 'forgets' about the other.</p>
    <h3>2. Allow Bluetooth scanning to be performed</h3>
    <p>On phones running the latest Android version, the first time you select the "FIND PAIRED MANNEQUIN" button you will get a dialogue pop up indicated that permission is required. You're being asked to let the application perform Bluetooth scanning which is how your micro:bit will be found (your mannnequin by the way is 'advertising' so it can be found). You should grant permission by selecting 'Allow' and then select the FIND... button again.</p>
    <h2>Finding Your mannequin</h2>
    <p>To use any of the demos in this application, the first thing you must do is tell your phone to try to detect your mannequin using Bluetooth.</p>
    <p>Start by pressing the FIND button at the foot of the first screen and this will
        cause your phone to start scanning for your mannequin which are within Bluetooth range. </p>
    <p class="important_text">IMPORTANT:</p>
    <p>By default, only mannequins you have paired your phone with will be listed for selection. If you haven't yet paired your device then follow the instructions in the 'Pairing' section below and then return to this application and select FIND again.</p>
    <p>To allow the application to be used with microbit (this is embedded within the mannequin) firmware builds which do not implement Bluetooth security, you can disable the filtering on non-paired devices from within the Settings screen which is accessible from the overflow menu.
    </p>
    <h2>PAIRING</h2>
    <p>To pair your mannequin with your phone, go into the Android Settings screen and select Bluetooth.
        If your mannequin is powered on and in range, then you should see it listed in the bottom part of the Bluetooth Settings screen in a section probably entitled "Available Devices".</p>
